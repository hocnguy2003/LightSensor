This project involves designing a simple yet effective light sensor system for a bathroom using basic electronic components
This project involves designing a simple yet effective light sensor system for a bathroom using basic electronic components, including an LDR (light sensor), a thermistor (temperature sensor), op-amps, and an LED. The primary goal is to ensure energy efficiency by turning the light on only when both conditions are met: the bathroom is dark, and a person is present.
