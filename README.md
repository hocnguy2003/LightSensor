# Light Sensor

# Description:

* This project involves designing a simple yet effective light sensor system for a bathroom using basic electronic components, including LDRs, thermistors, op-amps, LEDs, potentiometer, AND gates. The primary goal is to ensure energy efficiency by turning the light on only when both conditions are met: the bathroom is dark, and a person is present.

# Logics:  
* If the bathroom is dark (light sensor) and a person walks in (temperature sensor). The light will turn on. 
* If the bathroomâ€™s light is off (ON) but there is no present of a person (OFF), the light sensor is still turned off (OFF)
* If the person is in the bathroom (ON) with the light on (OFF), the light sensor  is still turned off.
* If neither the light is off (OFF)  nor the person is in the bathroom (OFF), the light is turned off. (OFF)
